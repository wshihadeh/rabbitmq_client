module Overcommit
  # Distributes a list of arguments over multiple invocations of a command.
  #
  # This accomplishes the same functionality provided by `xargs` but in a
  # cross-platform way that does not require any pre-existing tools.
  #
  # One of the tradeoffs with this approach is that we no longer deal with a
  # single exit status from a command, but multiple (one for each invocation).
  #
  # This will return a struct similar to `Subprocess::Result` but with
  # additional `statuses`, `stdouts`, and `stderrs` fields so hook authors can
  # actually see the results of each invocation. If they don't care, the
  # standard `status`, `stdout`, and `stderr` will still work but be a
  # aggregation/concatenation of all statuses/outputs.
  class CommandSplitter
