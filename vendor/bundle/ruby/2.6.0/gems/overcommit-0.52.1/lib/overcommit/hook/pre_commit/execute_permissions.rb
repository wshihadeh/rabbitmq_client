module Overcommit::Hook::PreCommit
  # Checks for files with execute permissions, which are usually not necessary
  # in source code files (and are typically caused by a misconfigured editor
  # assigning incorrect default permissions).
  #
  # Protip: if you have some files that you want to allow execute permissions
  # on, you can disable this hook for those files by using the `exclude` option
  # on your .overcommit.yml file. Example:
  #
  #   ExecutePermissions:
  #     enabled: true
  #     exclude:
  #       - 'path/to/my/file/that/should/have/execute/permissions.sh'
  #       - 'directory/that/should/have/execute/permissions/**/*'

      # We have to look in two places to determine the execute permissions of a
      # file. The first is the Git tree for currently known file modes of all
      # files, the second is the index for any staged changes to file modes.
      # Staged changes take priority if they exist.
      #
      # This complexity is necessary because this hook can be run in the RunAll
      # context, where there may be no staged changes but we stil want to check
      # the permissions.
